# spc2ascii

Couldn't find anything online to read some UV-vis files under Linux without Wine, so here goes...

Many features not supported because I have specific needs - if you need them implemented let me know and I'll extend.

Arguments:      <input file>
Outputs:        ascii table to standard output
To compile:     gcc main.c -o spc2ascii -lm
